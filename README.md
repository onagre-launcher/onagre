## Disclaimer 

⚠️️ Onagre is currently unreleased. 
Until the roadmap is completed, expect breaking changes, bugs and performance issues. ⚠️

## Difference with wofi/rofi

I built onagre for my main setup (sway/i3) as an alternative to [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) so it's worth mentioning there are a few differences : 

- Window transparency.
- Rounded corners (even on sway).
- Several default plugins (thanks to pop-launcher)
- Change mode with prefix not rofi like modi.
  
## Install

**Dependencies** :
- [pop-launcher](https://github.com/pop-os/launcher) > 1.0.1 (for arch users there is and AUR package out there)
- [Qalculate](http://qalculate.github.io/) (optional)

**Installation:**

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/oknozor/onagre
```

## Usage

**1. Key bindings:**


| Key     | Action  | 
| :----   | :-----  |
| `Arrow up/down` | Change selection |
| `Tab`   | Autocomplete (in files mode) | 
| `Esc`   | Quit without launching | 
| `Enter` | Launch selection | 

**2. Modes:**

To change mode simply type the mode prefix followed by a space and a query. 
For example `ddg onagre launcher` will open a DuckDuckGo search query with your default browser.

Mode with no prefix are enabled by default, there entry will be mixed in the search results.

## Configuration

### External mode

**1. Example:**

You can add mode from external commands like so: 

```toml
# Integrate `pass` password manager.
# Note that we need to run command in a subshell to escape double quotes and have env variables accessible.
[modes.pass]
source = "sh -c \"cd $HOME/.password-store && fd -t f . | sed s/\\.gpg//\""
# Execute this command on `enter` `%` will be replaced with the selected entry
target = "sh -c \"pass -c %\""
```

**2. Alternate config:**

You can provide alternate config and theme with the `--config` and `--theme` flags.
For more info run `onagre --help`.

## Theming

Onagre will look for a theme file in `$XDG_CONFIG_DIR/onagre/theme.toml` and will fall back to the default theme if none is found.

⚠ Until the theming API is stabilized you can take a look at [the examples](docs/theme_examples)
